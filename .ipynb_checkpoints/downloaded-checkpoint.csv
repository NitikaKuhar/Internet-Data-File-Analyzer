With over 40 contracts across 6 continents, over 70% of our employees are veterans and or have intel/law enforcement experience. We fully understand the unique challenges of our clients and work to identify, vet, implement, and enhance commercial and proprietary technologies to provide full scope solutions, because we have been there. Praescient has extensive experience designing, developing, and integrating solutions for customers including the US Army, Special Operations Command (SOCOM), US Navy (USN), US Marine Corps (USMC), US Coast Guard (USCG), Department of Justice (DOJ), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), intelligence community, and local law enforcement agencies, among others.The U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office and its investigative partners encounter urgent and complex investigative needs when investigating federal crimes or prosecuting civil cases. The standard IT systems made available through EOUSA are not designed to adequately support the data analytics needed to best advance these cases.

As such, the U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office requires sophisticated and specialized data analytic tools and support to load, organize, assimilate, and summarize large amounts of data, both structured and unstructured, and information related to major criminal investigations of corrupt public figures, cybercriminals, violent gangs, white-collar fraudsters, opioid traffickers, other targets actively pursued by our Civil Frauds unit who are engaged in systematic frauds perpetrated upon government agencies.Praescient Analytics is in search of a Mid-Level Data Analytics Solutions Analyst to provide support for projects related to investigations and litigation cases.
